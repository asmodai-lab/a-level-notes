Does Christianity tackle social issues more effectively than Marxism?
{ #TMAhQ9qd}


Christianity is more effective because suffering comes from original sin.
{ #33D9BaQH}


One must seek salvation through God's grace. Marx's focus on political liberation fails to acknowledge Christ dying for our sins.
{ #eIag49h7}


There is no proof that original sin actually exists, and that Christianity is correct. If it isn't, it is effectively doing nothing.
{ #fTPXsxUe}


Marxism is far more effective at dealing with social issues through it's analysis of the bigger picture.
{ #gpt0Lyhc}


structural sin
{ #KE2cK6up}


If society cannot avoid sin through the structures it has built, surely we must target those structures over all else.
{ #HFyzjQz0}


Marx's writings are largely a critique of society, not a method for how to help anyone, or any methods of governance.
{ #oLCTyn7t}


Even though the Church is deeply flawed, it still aims to help people on both individual and systemic levels. Marxism cannot do that, because it is not a powerful organisation.
{ #dPqSk56Y}


The church has been and still is in many areas, incredibly corrupt. It is far too focussed on orthodoxy over orthopraxis- more focussed on only doing the 'right thing' and often doing nothing at all. 
{ #P8JuQrmo}


While the church is unhelpful and corrupt in many ways, it supports people on a global level.
{ #XtwerijH}


This support is incredibly individualistic, in like with Christ's teachings
{ #9wwGPxGa}


It's not in line with Christ's teachings. He attempted to become king, for fucks sake!
{ #LwdyC4Uc}


While Christianity does mostly tackle social issues on an individual scale, this is not to say that it is less effective than Marxism.
{ #KjVOK6hp}


We could list flaws of Christian doctrine and action all day long, but the fact of the matter is that the Church is a global organisation that supports people on a global scale. Even individualistic, grass-roots help is still help: and it is more than what an ideology is doing. 
{ #p1cIm3t4}


This question ultimately presents a false dichotomy. The answer cannot be anything other than the Christianity, because it is more effective by basis of actually acting. 
{ #lF5OOupL}
