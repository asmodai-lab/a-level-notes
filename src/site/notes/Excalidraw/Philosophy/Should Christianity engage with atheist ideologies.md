Should Christianity engage with secular atheist ideologies?
{ #K9s5WxbF}


Marxism is inherently an atheist ideology, founded in a rejection of God.
{ #hempCqyT}


It encourages violence and methods of government: both of which are opposed to Christianity's core values
{ #7i8jOQwa}


But political revolution is part of the Bible. Jesus intended to become King; isn't that suggesting a method of governance?
{ #D3eFGYCI}


And since Jesus is the only king, it would be insulting for anyone to take his position. So, wouldn't a society where everyone is equal be perfect? 
{ #s2iiV9cC}


Marxism encourages violence as something necessary for making a better world. Jesus' thing was that he was non-violent. 
{ #MQMFtCTn}


But does Christianity need to adopt all of Marx's values in order to engage with Marxism?
{ #U2aF887i}


Boff; Marx is a 'useful companion', but JC is the only teacher.
{ #GAiSgAT4}


Shouldn't the church be uninvolved in politics? It is a part of the 'city of man', and so is inherently sinful.
{ #AubTReBN}


We are inherently imperfect/sinful, so involving ourselves in an avenue that is doomed to fail is pointless. 
{ #O9VwtDoP}


and yet, choosing to turn a blind eye because there is heaven at the end is an evil, lazy idea. 
{ #vgC0pTZ2}


Also, isn't the 'kingdom of God' upon us/among us/within us? It isn't entirely beyond us according to the Bible.
{ #mWcAm5mL}


'The kingdom of God is upon us!' (Mark)
'For when the son of man comes among us, he will say 'for i was hungry, and you gave me something to eat...' (Matthew)

{ #jymvg3zT}


The Bible encourages 'setting the oppressed free', and freeing the imprisoned, and that the 'year of our Lord' (which forgave debt) is upon us
{ #UQlpRIYc}
