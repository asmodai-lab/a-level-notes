## Plato on Dualism
Plato is the original dualist. He believes that the body and soul are separate, and that the soul lives on after the death of the body.
1. body and soul are opposites —  material and imperfect versus spiritual and perfect. They are two separate substances that interact.
2. Changing — the body is constantly changing so cannot be a source of truth. The soul is immortal, in the world of forms, unchanging, and a source of truth
3. The soul is the real identity of a person — we have a body, but we aren't a body: our inner mental life is the most important part of ourselves. 
4. In conflict — the soul seeks intellectual pursuits but the body seeks material pleasures, and the body can only rely on unreliable sensory experience — and so it cannot access the truth.
5. Charioteer — reason is the highest thing and allows us to know the world of forms, emotion inspires us but can make us reckless, appetites ensure we look after our bodies but can lead us into hedonism. A good person is one whose soul is properly balanced with reason in charge.
