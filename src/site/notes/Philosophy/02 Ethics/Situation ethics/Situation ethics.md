# Questions on Situation ethics

• whether or not situation ethics provides a helpful method of moral decision-making
• whether or not an ethical judgement about something being good, bad, right or wrong can be based on the extent to which, in any given situation, agape is best served
• whether Fletcher’s understanding of agape is really religious or whether it means nothing more than wanting the best for the person involved in a given situation
• whether or not the rejection of absolute rules by situation ethics makes moral decision-making entirely individualistic and subjective
