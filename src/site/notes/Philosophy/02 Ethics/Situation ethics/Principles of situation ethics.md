# Principles

### Agape

Agape= love. 
>it is drawn from Jesus saying that the 'greatest commandment' is to 'love your neighbour as yourself.'
>	Fletcher interprets this as being love is all that matters in ethics. 
>		so the rest of the 10 commandments do not matter. Only love does. 
###### For example;

Fletcher gives the example of a family hiding from bandits when their baby starts crying- which would reveal where they are hiding. 
	 Fletcher says that the most loving thing to do is to kill the baby, otherwise everyone else will die; including the baby.
*Isn't this just the trolley problem?*


### The four working principles

These are how to apply situation ethics/agape to ethics. 

1. **Pragmatism**; an action must take into account the reality of the situation
2. **Relativism**; all absolutes become relative to love.
	1. *'Not absolutizing the relative means that it is not total relativism where any moral claim could be justified. It is always relative to love which means that only moral claims which are valid when relative to love will be justified for Fletcher'*
3. **Positivism**; ethics has to have faith in love
4. **Personalism**; put people above the rules
	1. 'The sabbath was made for man, not man for sabbath.'- Jesus.

### The six fundamental principles

1. **love is** the **only thing** that is **intrinsically good**
2. **love** is the **ruling norm** in **ethical decision making** and **replaces all laws**
3. love and justice are the same thing: **justice is love distributed**
4. **love** wills the neighbour's good **regardless** of whether the neighbour is liked
5. **only** the **end** justifies the **means**; nothing else
6. **Love** decides on **each** situation as it arises **without** a set of **laws** to guide it

# Fletcher's views on Conscience

>Fletcher thought that conscience was what enabled one to figure out how to apply agape in any situation.
>He says that conscience is a verb, not a noun; indicating that he disagrees with the view that conscience is an internal moral compass/ the intuitive ability to tell right from wrong.
