## Class
### Socio-economic class
This refers to the categorisation of people based on income, occupation, and social status. Traditionally, these have been working, middle, and upper class. However, nowadays it is much more complicated.

In the UK, classes are now grouped as:
1. AB: Higher managerial/professional roles
2. C1: lower managerial/professional roles
3. C2: skilled manual workers
4. DE: semi-skilled and unskilled workers, unemployed, or retired
Obviously, the job descriptions for all of these can be very inaccurate when determining class. It's a generalist approach, not a 100% correct one. 

Socio-economic class historically played a large role in voting behaviour. The commonly held views on how class affects voting behaviour are as follows:
- Labour appeals to C2DE voters because it appeals to the working class by funding a welfare state and supporting worker's rights
- Conservatives appeal to ABC1 voters because their policies favour low taxes and businesses
Nowadays, these assumptions aren't really correct.
